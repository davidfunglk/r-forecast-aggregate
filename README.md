# R Scripts for Forecast Aggregation

### Purpose
Forecasts often come in a variety of formats based on the Enterprise Resource Planning, or ERP, systems in use. For any one involved in supply chain or business planning, this becomes a burden trying to sort through an endless amount of exported files -- often in ```.csv``` or ```.xlsx``` format -- from different sources and attempting to consolidate everything into one master file. And by the time that process is completed, new forecasts would be presented to render the consolidation useless.

The scripts in this repository serve as examples of data manipulation in R that can be used to quickly standardize the formats of different forecasts. And while I have framed these scripts in the context of business forecasting, similar scripts can be applied to any projects where it is necessary to remove extraneous information and to format tables from wide to long or long to wide.
